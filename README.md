# The VoxBlink Dataset

The VoxBlink dataset is a Large Scale speaker verification dataset obtained from YouTube platform. This repository provides guidelines some scripts for building the corpus with the annotation files. For more introduction, please see [cite](https://VoxBlink.github.io). 

## Resource 
Let's start with obtaining the [resource](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vP8hyT_Zefj2d40JzHLAUJWy_dBjpA22?usp=drive_link) files and decompressing tar-files.
```bash
tar -zxvf timestamp.tar.gz
tar -zxvf video_tags.tar.gz 
```

## File structure


```
% The file structure is summarized as follows: 
|---- resource                  # resource folder
