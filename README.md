# The VoxBlink Dataset

The VoxBlink dataset is a Large Scale speaker verification dataset obtained from YouTube platform. This repository provides guidelines for downloading and accessing the dataset, along with necessary scripts. For more introduction, please see [cite](https://VoxBlink.github.io). 

## Resource 
Let's start with obtaining the [resource](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vP8hyT_Zefj2d40JzHLAUJWy_dBjpA22?usp=drive_link) files and decompressing tar-files.
```bash
tar -zxvf timestamp.tar.gz
tar -zxvf video_tags.tar.gz 
```

## File structure
